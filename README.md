## **How It Works**

### **Example Conversations**

```
Doctor: "Show me all diabetic patients who haven't had checkups in 6 months"
AI: Here are 14 patients matching your criteria... [displays results]

Doctor: "Schedule appointments for all of them next week"
AI: I've scheduled 14 appointments between Monday and Friday...

Doctor: "Add a note that they need A1C tests"
AI: Notes added to all 14 appointments. Should I also order the lab work?

Doctor: "Yes, and send reminders to their phones"
AI: Lab orders created and SMS reminders scheduled.
```
